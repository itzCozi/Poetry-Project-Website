Analytical Analysis


         The poem "Mother to Son" by Langston Hughes tells about a mother talking to her son about life and its difficulties, and to never give up. Langston uses symbolism in the shape of the "Crystal staircase" which he uses to symbolize the expectation of life being easy. The author compares an old torn up staircase, using descriptive phrases like tacks in the stairs and boards torn up with no carpet, to show how difficult life was for her, in comparison to the crystal staircase that she might have expected. This shows the depressing reality that life doesn't always go how we expect. She says she has to take risks without knowing the consequences she says on lines 12 and 13 "And sometimes goin’ in the dark; Where there ain’t been no light.” I think the poet uses these two objects to compare and contrast the reality of life from one's expectation.
        Langston also uses diction when he leaves out the G's and spells words improperly, this shows the speaker may be under educated or impoverished. This may be due to the fact that her early stages of life weren’t crystal, she didn’t have an opportunity to get properly educated. An example of this diction is in lines 9-11 the author writes "I’se been a-climbin’ on, And reachin’ landin’s, And turnin’ corners" in this quote the author leaves off the G's in landing, reaching and turning making the sentence easier to say like the words flow together this shows the speaker may not have a lot of time to learn proper english or speak it when leaving letters off is faster.
